# About the Game
This is a simple game where the player can test their memory by flipping cards two at a time until they find a pair.

The game continues until until either the player gives up under immense frustration, or the play successfully finds every pair.

# My Implementation
Currently the implementation is basic. No timer, no score tracking, or anything like that. I built the initial version in 2 hours, entirely from scratch except for a randomizing/sorting algorithm that I grabbed from StackOverflow. I linked to that forum in the comments.
